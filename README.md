# Dash and Plotly

Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. No JavaScript required.

Built on top of Plotly.js, React and Flask, Dash ties modern UI elements like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs directly to your analytical Python code.

Dash apps are rendered in the web browser. You can deploy your apps to servers and then share them through URLs. Since Dash apps are viewed in the web browser, Dash is inherently cross-platform and mobile ready.

Dash is open source, and its apps run on the web browser. You can deploy Dash on your own servers, or on services like Heroku, AWS, GCP, Azure, or DigitalOcean.

Dash is written on Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js.
